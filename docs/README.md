This is your Development README, which will:

show wireframes,
describe features, and
outline a development timeline for your application.

The Development README of your project repo MUST include the following:

Heroku Link

At the end of the first day of full-stack projects, you should have a link to the live version of your site. It doesn't have to be pretty, but it has to be there. Push to Heroku ASAP!

Minimum Viable Product

Write a one-sentence summary of the project and a list of the features that would be absolutely necessary for the app to be marketable. Your MVP section must follow the format outlined here.

Wireframes

Annotate your wireframes. Which React component corresponds to each element? Keep grids in mind while roughly drafting your layout.

/wireframes
Links to wireframes of your application's UI views. Each wireframe should be a basic representation of the layout and information presented in a view. Since you will certainly use nested React components, clearly indicate the hierarchy in your wireframes. We should be able to see every view of your website using your wireframes, and how each view is reached.

NB: Your wireframes will be viewed not only by yourself and the App Academy staff, but potentially future employers. If you are going to use pen and paper, it should look great. Otherwise, we recommend draw.io.

React Components

component-hierarchy.md
In addition to the wireframes, you should diagram a tree indicating your application's overall component structure.

Discuss how you will nest your components. If components will need containers, indicate what state and dispatch props they will need. For presentational components, discuss what props and state they will need.

Map out your React Routes with their respective components and paths.

See the sample project proposal for an example of this.

Sample State

sample-state.md
Create a basic illustration of your state shape. Think about what information you need to store for your app to work, and how best to organize it to minimize duplication and maximize ease of access.

DB Schema

schema.md
Link to a document outlining the database schema for your app. Build up the schema by walking through your app's wireframes. Think carefully about what data will be needed for each view and the best way to store that data. Make note of any database-level validations and foreign key relationships.

API Endpoints

api-endpoints.md
Link to a page that lists your Rails API endpoints. Break these up between HTML and JSON endpoints. Discuss what params, if any, will be needed for each endpoint, and what information will be returned.

Implementation Timeline

Create a section in your proposal README for each phase of your project to develop an implementation timeline.

Refer back to your MVP and group the features into logical phases. Rather than building the entire project all at once, you're going to implement one feature at a time. You should have a working app at the end of each phase (even if not all of your features are in yet).

This is crucial both here and in the industry. The truth is, one never knows how long implementing any particular phase will take. Constraints change. Timelines are shortened without warning. An app after any phase must be able to stand on it's on. We call this building in 'slices' instead of 'layers'.
